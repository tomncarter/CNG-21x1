# CNG-21x1: Foundations of Networking – Course Description

CNG-21x1 is a 14-week, lab-intensive course designed to teach students the foundational concepts of computer networking through real-world, open-source tools. The course uses container-based network emulation to explore protocols such as Ethernet, IP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, and MPLS. 

Students will gain hands-on experience designing and troubleshooting network topologies using Containerlab and Docker, while learning the OSI and DoD networking models. Historical context is woven throughout the curriculum, and each week features a comic case study via “Ned,” our fictional junior engineer who makes common mistakes so students don’t have to.

By the end of the course, students will be able to build, configure, analyze, and document complex Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks using real protocols and open tools.
