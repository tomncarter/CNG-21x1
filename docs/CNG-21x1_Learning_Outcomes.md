# CNG-21x1: Foundations of Networking – Course Learning Outcomes

## Required Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Construct** container‑based network topologies using Containerlab and Docker.  
2. **Configure** Ethernet switching and VLANs to enable proper Layer‑2 forwarding.  
3. **Analyze** packet flows using `tcpdump` and Wireshark to identify MAC learning, flooding, and drops.  
4. **Apply** IPv4 subnetting and CIDR techniques to design and implement multi‑subnet addressing plans.  
5. **Deploy** routing protocols (OSPF, IS‑IS, BGP) within Containerlab topologies to establish end‑to‑end connectivity.  
6. **Manipulate** BGP attributes (AS‑path, local‑pref, route‑maps) to influence path selection and policy.  
7. **Implement** MPLS forwarding and VRF‑based Layer‑3 VPNs in multi‑router environments.  
8. **Design** EVPN/VXLAN overlay networks to enable segment routing and multi‑tenant connectivity.  
9. **Troubleshoot** network issues using CLI tools (`ping`, `traceroute`, `show`), packet analysis, and documentation.  
10. **Integrate** Git version control into networking workflows to manage topology YAML, configurations, and lab results in a reproducible manner.

## Recommended Learning Outcomes (if time permits)

11. **Explain** historical milestones and their impact on modern networking (e.g., ARPANET, Ethernet invention, STP, IP allocation).  
12. **Reflect** on common networking errors and how adherence to best practices prevents them—learned via Ned’s Corner scenarios.
